KKP requires a cluster to be installed in, we usually use Kubeone for it, the normal KubeOne install has has 3 masters 3 workers nodes. 
KKP gets into 1 kubermetic cluster, KubeOne is the vanilla one, for a single process. All docs can be found here - As for steps:

- You need to provision the hardware Provision infrastructure, can be done manually or by terraforming. 
- KubeOne CLI can be used to provision everything. In the KubeOne GIt I can find the examples of the tools, from AWS and for other cloud providers.
- To terraform: https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubeone/v1.2/infrastructure/terraform_configs/ 
- For provisioning: https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubeone/v1.2/provisioning/ - Can be done in any Cloud or Prem as Packet.
- There's gonna be 2 clusters, master and a seed cluster. There's gonna be 2 clusters depending the setup in the Cloud.

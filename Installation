KKP requires a cluster to be installed in, we usually use Kubeone for it, the normal KubeOne install has has 3 masters 3 workers nodes. 
KKP gets into 1 kubermetic cluster, KubeOne is the vanilla one, for a single process. All docs can be found here - As for steps:

- You need to provision the hardware Provision infrastructure, can be done manually or by terraforming. 
- KubeOne CLI can be used to provision everything. In the KubeOne GIt I can find the examples of the tools, from AWS and for other cloud providers.
- To terraform: https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubeone/v1.2/infrastructure/terraform_configs/ 
- For provisioning: https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubeone/v1.2/provisioning/ - Can be done in any Cloud or Prem as Packet.
- There's gonna be 2 clusters, master and a seed cluster. There's gonna be 2 clusters depending the setup in the Cloud. 

Steps for the installation of KKP:

Step -1 -https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubeone/v1.2/infrastructure/terraform_configs/
Step -2- https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubeone/v1.2/provisioning/
Step -3 - https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.17/guides/installation/install_kkp_ce/
Step -4 - https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.17/guides/installation/install_kkp_ce/#:~:text=create%20dns%20records
Step -5  - Get seed config from tarball. And follow this link - https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.17/guides/installation/add_seed_cluster_ce/
Step -6 -  https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.17/guides/installation/add_seed_cluster_ce/#:~:text=update%20dns
Step -7  - https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.17/tutorials_howtos/project_and_cluster_management/

STEPS SUMMARY:

	• git clone https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone.git

	• Edit Terraformts.vars

	• Then copy the contents of the page step 1: you gotta have a key predefined into your AWS account

	• Then export AWS key and secret

	• Turn on ssh agent

	• Terraform init from the folder you have the terraform folder Git Repos/kkp-demo/examples/terraform/aws

	• Then terraform apply (we use bastion host)

	• Create kubeone.yaml and copy the configuration from kubeone/provisioning

	• After terraform runs, you need to export into tf.json output -json > tf.json

	• Then apply via kubeone tool apply --manifest kubeone.yaml -t tf.json

	• To check the kubeone options is kubeone config print

	• I have to add KUBECONFIG everytime: export KUBECONFIG='/mnt/c/Users/damia.LAPTOP-JS9C9AKO/Documents/Git Repos/kkp-demo/examples/terraform/aws/kkp-demo-kubeconfig

	• -----This is kubeone cluster running

	• For KKP we need to download and install the tarball from the site then run : wget https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/download/v2.17.3/kubermatic-ce-v2.17.3-darwin-amd64.tar.gz

	• Then extract tar ball -tar

	• Prepare 3 files

	• 
	• Add the DNS and the host to the files, encrypt the passwords for the files and add the configuration needed

	• Then we gotta add in AWS, add the storage: Install script: ./kubermatic-installer deploy --config examples/kubermatic.example.ce.yaml --helm-values examples/values.example.yaml --storageclass aws

	• Add rules to the DNS and seed.
